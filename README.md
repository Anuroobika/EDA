# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on CardioFitness data

Below are the 5 steps that we could use to understand the data better through EDA
1.	Understand the problem: 
Understand the meaning of each variable, the problem statement and the importance of each variable for the particular problem
2. Univariate study: 
Focus on the variables and try to understand a little more about the variables especially the dependent variable
3. Multivariate study:
Understand how the dependent and independent variables relate to each other
4. Basic cleaning:
Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers and categorical variables
5. Test assumptions:
Check the basic assumptions that you have got from multivariate study analysis
